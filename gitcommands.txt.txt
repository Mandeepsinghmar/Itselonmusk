=> learnt basic of git and github from "codewithharry" if the repository is private then follow these steps

git config --global user.name Mandeep

git config --global user.email "singhmar1655@gmail.com"

touch .gitignore ( to ignore any folder)

git init

git add .

git commit -m "Initial commit"

git status

git remote add origin git@github.com:Mandeepsinghmar/itselonmusk.git ( this is the SSH link that we have to take from the new repository where we are trying to push our source code ) 

git push origin master

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "singhmar1655@gmail.com"

cat /c/Users/HP/.ssh/id_rsa.pub  ( in this step after getting key paste that key on github)

git push origin master


-( we have not to say "git init" everytime)

commands for " if we have to add extra folder to our exist repository"
 git add .

git commit -m "Added nameoffolder"

git push origin master





Easy command that i learn from tanay pratap=>>> 

git init

echo "# itselonmusk" >> README.md

git add .

git remote add origin git@github.com:Mandeepsinghmar/itselonmusk.git ( this is the SSH link that we have to take from the new repository where we are trying to push our source code )

git push origin master

git status

git commit -m "first commit"
